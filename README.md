## Overview

The RAG Chatbot on Streamlit with Speech Functionality is an application that allows users to interact with a chatbot using their own data, supported by zero-to-few shot prompts and chat history. The chatbot uses a combination of Huggingface embeddings, OpenAI language models, and Streamlit for the UI, incorporating text-to-speech functionality for an enhanced user experience.
